// we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

// splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
// array now equals ['today', 'was', 'great']
// splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray equals ['really', 'happy']


// ===============================
// Another example
// ===============================

function sumOfTen(arr) {
    // change code below this line
    
    // change code above this line
    return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  }
  
  // do not change code below this line
  console.log(sumOfTen([2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1]));



// ===================================================================
// Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, we can go one step further with splice() â€” in addition to removing elements, we can use that third parameter, which represents one or more elements, to add them as well. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. For instance, let's say you're storing a color scheme for a set of DOM elements in an array, and want to dynamically change a color based on some action:

function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {
  arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);
  return arr;
}

let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];

colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');
// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place
// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
